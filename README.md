### Usage
Your tasks appear as a list on the main screen. To add a new task, select the ![Plus Sign](https://github.com/lmitchell4/Tasker/blob/master/readme_img/plus_sign_small.png) button in the upper right corner. 
Each task is required to have at least a name, but it can also optionally have notes, a high priority star (![Priority star](https://github.com/lmitchell4/Tasker/blob/master/readme_img/star_priority_multicolor_small.png)), and a date. 
To add a date, hit the ADD DATE button, which will automatically insert the current date and bring up a calendar so that you 
can change the date as needed.  To access a different month, swipe the calendar up or down.  To remove an existing date, use 
the CLEAR DATE button. When you are done, press either the DONE button in the upper right corner to add the new task to your to-do list,
or hit CANCEL to return without creating a new task.

Use the checkbox (![Checkbox](https://github.com/lmitchell4/Tasker/blob/master/readme_img/checkmark.png)) to the left of the task name to mark that a task has been completed.
To make changes to an existing task, long-tap the task row and select Edit. To delete a task, long-tap and select Delete.
